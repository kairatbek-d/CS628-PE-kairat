# Recipe Finder

# Input
The Recipe Finder application allows users to add, view, edit, and delete recipes. Users can enter recipe details such as the name, ingredients, and cooking instructions through a form. When viewing the list of recipes, users can click on a recipe to see more details or update its information. They can also remove a recipe if they no longer need it.

# Process
The application is built with React for the front end and Node.js with Express for the back end. MongoDB Atlas stores the recipes. React Router is used to navigate between pages. When users add, edit, or delete a recipe, the front end sends requests to the back end, which updates the database. The data is then fetched and displayed dynamically. The useParams hook fetches specific recipes based on their ID. The application handles user interactions, updates the UI, and ensures data consistency.

# Output
Users see a list of recipes, detailed views of each recipe, and forms for adding or editing recipes. Changes are updated in real-time. If a recipe is deleted, it is removed from the list. The app ensures a smooth user experience by displaying messages and updating the interface accordingly.
