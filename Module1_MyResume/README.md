<h3>My Resume - React Application</h3>

<p>This is a React application that builds a resume webpage. There is no external input (Input). The application itself (Process) generates the content of the resume based on pre-defined information within the code. This information includes name, contact details, education history, skills, work experience, and projects.</p>

<p>The Process involves structuring this information into HTML elements using JavaScript (JSX) within the Resume.js component. The styles for the layout and formatting are defined in the Resume.css file.</p>

<p>The Output of the program is a visually appealing resume webpage that we can customize further by editing the content in Resume.js. We can view this webpage in our browser, and it will display our resume information in a clear and organized manner. The background color will be set to rgba(#bdfb04), and the default text color will be black, as specified in the CSS.</p>
